### Cleaning up ###

Eventually, you may want to clean out unnecessary images and the cache of containers, to reclaim space or just keep things tidy. Cleaning up involves two steps, removing the containers that you've run first, then removing the images themselves.

To remove the containers, including those that have exited and are still in the cache, use `docker ps --all` to get the IDs, then `docker rm` followed by the container ID(s) or the container name(s):

```
$ docker ps --all
```
{: .bash}

```

You can construct your own one-liner to clean up everything, if you wish. Docker will refuse to delete something that's actively in use, so you won't screw things up too badly this way.

```
$ docker rm `docker ps --all -q`
```
{: .bash}

```

```
{: .output}

Now that we've removed the containers, let's clean up the images they came from. This uses the `docker images` and `docker rmi` commands, in a similar manner:

```
$ docker images
```
{: .bash}

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu              latest              4ca3a192ff2a        22 hours ago        128.2 MB
nginx               latest              abf312888d13        2 days ago          181.5 MB
```
{: .output}

```
$ docker rmi ubuntu
```
{: .bash}

```

You need to be sure to stop and remove a container before removing its image.  If not, you'll see an error about child images:

```
$ docker ps --all
```
{: .bash}

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS                  NAMES

```
$ docker rmi nginx
```
