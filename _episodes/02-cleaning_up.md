## Objective ##

Learn how to remove containers and images from your machine when you no longer need them

### Cleaning Up ###
Eventually, you may want to clean out the cache of images and the history of containers, to reclaim space or just keep things tidy. Cleaning up involves two steps, removing the containers that you've run first, then removing the images themselves.

To remove the containers, including those that have exited and are still in the cache, use **docker ps --all** to get the ids, then  **docker rm** with the container ID or the container name:

```
> docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES

```

You can concoct your own one-liner to clean up everything, if you wish. Docker will refuse to delete something that's actively in use, so you won't screw things up too badly this way

```
> docker rm `docker ps --all -q`
48a2dca14407
1bf15ca4ba89
97b1e86df1f1
```

Now that we've removed the containers, let's clean up the images they came from. This uses the **docker images** and **docker rmi** commands, in a similar manner:

```
> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu              latest              4ca3a192ff2a        22 hours ago        128.2 MB
nginx               latest              abf312888d13        2 days ago          181.5 MB

> docker rmi ubuntu nginx

You need to be sure to stop a container before removing its image.  If not, you'll see an error about child images:

```
> docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
bf0a1726909a        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   18 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds       0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   eloquent_raman

> docker rmi nginx
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "nginx" (must force) - container a4dbdb7eb4b1 is using its referenced image 71c43202b8ac
```

### Conclusion ###
Cleaning up containers and images is a two-step process. Now you should be able to keep your system tidy.

### Best practices ###

- use the ```--rm``` flag when you know you won't want to re-start a container
- if you use containers heavily, clean up the images from time to time
